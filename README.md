# Brewing Creativity: My Front-End Development Journey with a Coffee Shop Website

```
ðŸš© Note:this description is subject to change in the future !!
```

This project marks my initial foray into front-end web development, showcasing my proficiency in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) ,[Reactjs](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and other frameworks. The user interface for this project was designed by the [SabzLearn](https://sabzlearn.ir) website and taught by instructor Mr. Abadi, while I converted the design into code myself.

This project has not been deployed; it is solely intended to demonstrate the technologies I utilized. The back-end of this project is real and was developed by [Mr. Behrad Saraiyeh](https://github.com/Behradsa). For managing API responses, I used the [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) libraries.
